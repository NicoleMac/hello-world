# hello-world
My name is Nicole MacGregor. I  am 27 years old from Mexico City. I have a civil engineering degree and two years of professional experience at a private equity. At the moment I'm starting a business with some friends that aims to tackle the plastic problem. I am a very active person and enjoy being outdoors.
